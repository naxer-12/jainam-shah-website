It&#x27;s a simple carpooling calculator that allows you to find out how much a trip will cost each person involved.
I designed and built Wagon Pool from scratch without any previous Objective C or Xcode experience.
While it&#x27;s still fresh in my mind I wanted to document the process I took in building it.</p><p>My hope for this project was to be able to ship something I was proud of.
I wanted the app to be simple, focused, and better than alternative options.</p><p>I also wanted to have a good understanding of what it takes to build an iOS application.
I needed to learn Object Oriented Programming and learn mobile development on its own terms.</p><p>Getting Started, I got a notebook to help organize my thoughts. I sketched, illustrated, and diagrammed my way through the entire process.
This gave me extra mental space, and helped me visualize what was going on in my head.</p><p><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:none;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0"><img alt="Prototype designs for feedback" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%"/><noscript><img alt="Prototype designs for feedback" src="/images/wagon-notepad.jpg" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;bottom:0;right:0;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0;border:none;margin:auto;display:block;width:0;height:0;min-width:100%;max-width:100%;min-height:100%;max-height:100%" loading="lazy"/></noscript></span></p><h2>Design</h2><p>I wanted the app to look polished and to make calculating easy.

A friend challenged me to make something memorable.
