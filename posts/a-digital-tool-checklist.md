# A Digital Tool Checklist

This is my checklist for considering a digital tool.

## It should be as fast as my fingers.

I love snappy software. Tools should be fast to launch, search, and use. See: [Fast software, the best software](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/)

## It should be built with the right tools.

Use the right tool for the right job. If it's built once for everywhere it will be slow or violate platform conventions.

## It should allow me to own my information locally.

I'd like full control over my data, regardless of wifi connection or server status. See: [Local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)

## It should be well crafted visually.

At the very least, visually palatable. So many good developer tools are hampered here. They are fast and powerful, but hard to look at.

## It should have a well designed icon.

The app icon is a signal of app quality. An opportunity to go above and beyond.

## I should be able to buy it.

I don't like renting tools, and I'm suspicious of free ones. If I like it, I'd like to own it.

## Data should be portable.

No lock-ins. Software comes and goes. The data should persist.

## It should have first class keyboard support.

The alternative is carpal tunnel. If it can be done with the keyboard, it should be possible with the keyboard.

## It should help me stay focused.

If there are updates or notifications, let me discover them when it's convenient for me. Another reason I'd prefer native over web. Native has a dedicated space. The browser is a distraction war zone.

## It should be built on all relevant platforms.

And take advantage of platform strengths.

## It should teach skills/principles that outlive the tool.

Examples include Todo apps that teach GTD. Writing apps that train your focus.
