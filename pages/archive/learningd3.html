<p>
  In 2016 I created a video course to help people learn D3.js.
  On top of the course material, I designed and built a platform to sell the course.
  Building this really pushed me outside my comfort zone, but what I gained was well worth it.
  I learned valuable marketing, video, writing, product development, and back end skills.

  It's an empowering experience to build a concept from the initial idea and then execute at every level.
  You can learn more about the course on the <a href="https://learningd3.com">landing page</a>.
