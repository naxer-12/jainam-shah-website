<p>
    I built Wagon Pool in order to teach myself iOS development and design.
    It's a simple carpooling calculator that allows you to find out how much a trip will cost each person involved.
    It's no longer available on the app store, but you can read about <a href="{{ "/notebook/making-wagonpool" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">how I built it</a>.
