    <p>
      I worked at Deloitte as a product designer from 2012 to 2015.
      During that time, I led the design of a product called Semoss.
      Semoss is an context aware analytics tool that allows you to identify transitive relationships.
      I spent a lot of time using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">angular</a>
      for the development and <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> for the data visualizations.
